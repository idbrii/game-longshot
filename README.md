Like Worms mixed with Moonbase Commander.

## Summary

You launch RTS buildings instead of missiles. You start with one launcher
building that can fire mineshafts (get resources), barracks (pump out creeps),
bombs (terraform/defence), or more launchers. Tech tree lets you make them
bouncy, boosty, sticky.
